# Project Euler

I've created this repo to store my Project Euler problems and pseudocode / solution explanations.

It is my intention to solve these problems throughout my career. There are several hundred, so I'm unsure if I will ever finish. But, a man can dream, and the only certainty is that I will not finish if I don't try. So, here we go.
